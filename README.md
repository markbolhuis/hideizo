OpenEizo
========
A small WIP Linux HID device driver to control Eizo EV FlexScan monitors.

Aims
----
To reverse engineer the protocol used to control Eizo EV FlexScan monitors, and write an open source Linux driver as a 
replacement for Eizo's own proprietary and Windows only Screen InStyle software.

Monitor Support
---------------
This driver aims to support the following monitors.

Running
-------
By itself the driver only creates a child hid device using a secondary descriptor fetched from the monitor. This child
device provides a simplified interface for controlling the monitor.

Below is an example program using [hidapi](https://github.com/signal11/hidapi) to set the brightness to 85. Make sure
you have appropriate permissions using `udev/eizo.rules`, and add yourself to the `eizo` group.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <hidapi/hidapi.h>

int main() {
    hid_init();
    
    // Open the HID raw device
    // Set this to the path of the device the driver creates.
    struct hid_device_ *dev = hid_open_path("/dev/hidraw13");
    if(dev) {
        // Define a buffer big enough for the report
        // The maximum size for any report is 513
        unsigned char val[3];
        
        // Set the report number to brightness
        val[0] = 82;
        
        // Set the le uint16 brightness value
        val[1] = 170;
        val[2] = 0;
        
        // Send the report and either return an error or the actual number 
        // of bytes written.
        int len = hid_send_feature_report(dev, val, sizeof(val));
        if (len >= 0) {
            printf("%d bytes written", len);
        } else {
            const wchar_t *err = hid_error(dev);
            fwprintf(stderr, L"%ls\n", err);
        }

        hid_close(dev);
    }

    hid_exit();
    return 0;
}
```

Contributing
------------
If you have an EV FlexScan monitor then please open an issue with info on which monitor you have with its PID, so we can
work towards supporting it.

```shell
$ lsusb | grep 056d
Bus 003 Device 006: ID 056d:4059 EIZO Corp. FlexScan EV2760
```

In order to reverse engineer you will need to run a windows virtual machine with Eizo's software running and some packet
sniffer such as Wireshark with USBPcap/usbmon.
